  abstract = {Interval coding of binary images provides a representation in which the mathematical morphology operations of dilation and erosion by an arbitrary structuring element can be naturally and efficiently implemented on a serial computer. Conventional 4- or 8-neighbour dilation and erosion are then only special cases. Euclidean mapping is investigated as an example.},
